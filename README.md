# Provider_Snippets

This repository is meant to help medical scribes work more effectively with their providers by providing templates and pre-formatted checklists. Each SQLite database stored and maintained here contains lists made based on the preferences of a specific provider. This will help us ensure we are finishing everything that needs to be done in a patient chart when scribing. No patient-specific data will ever be uploaded to this repository. If you choose to contribute, ensure all information is thoroughly anonymous.

For use with [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) and [NppSnippets](https://github.com/ffes/nppsnippets). For instructions on installing and using the NppSnippets plugin, please visit [Read the Docs](https://nppsnippets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). 

Instructions on using Notepad++ and NppSnippets for scribing to be added here TBD
